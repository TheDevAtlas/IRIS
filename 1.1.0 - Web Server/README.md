# IRIS - 1.1.0 - Now working with Django to create a web app

This version has a much bigger gap between 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 as the code is now being focused toward user data and how they want their predicted data to be displayed. Using the previous 1.0.0 version as a baseline for the functions needed to predict stocks, now I need to focus that data towards a useable interface. Django lets me create a web app and user interaction so that someone can log in and see their data and prediction of their data.
