# IRIS - 0.1.0 - Proof Of Concept

These files took directly from "Predicting Stock Prices in Python" by Neural Nine in the suggested reading list. This was to get familiar with the imports and basic structure of prediction with python. I also tweaked it a bit to try and predict a cryptocurrency with not much success. Very bad organization and commenting on my part, but got the goal across of learning what I was doing.
