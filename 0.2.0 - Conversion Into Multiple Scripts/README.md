# IRIS - 0.2.0 - Conversion Into Multiple Scripts

0.2.0 is where I split from Neural Nine in almost every way. The codebase is now structured around saving and evolving one network and modifying and saving it into oblivion. This change is to see if I can train the bot more than once and then use it to predict future data as it evolves to get the margin of error down. Another adition is the use of multiple scripts instead of one big script to handle different tasks at once. The main script controls user input and the calls and returns of other functions and files, while other scripts like the trainNetwork evolves and saves the network.
