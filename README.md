This repo is a recreation of an old project of mine. This particular version of the project has evolved to take from multiple data sources and return "educated guesses" of future data using a neural net. While none of these "educated guesses" are accurate, they can yield interesting results and even correct predictions if you allow a margin of error. A project like this is meant to stretch someone's programming muscles as it dips into many areas of python and pulls those concepts together into one program. However, as with any program that tries to predict the future, it will never truly be able to know the influence of people and humanity. Due to this, I must say that this program should not inform you to invest, sell, or buy into any form of assets and should not be taken as financial advice. This project could turn into something more accurate or correct over time, but reality must be considered as well.

If you wish to take on a similar project here is some suggested reading (really watching).
